# Frequently Asked Questions

### What can it currently do?
You can create, load and play levels with a limited set of entities.

### That player code looks rather awful, will it kill me?
Hopefully not. It's stolen from the previous iteration of the project and serves as a nice test player in the meantime.

### I'm crazy, can I use your code in my project?
You can use any of my work here in non-commercial projects provided you place the same restriction on any derivative works. That, and don't just compile it and brand as it your own with no real changes. _That's just silly._
