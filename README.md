# Frequently Asked Questions

* __What can it currently do?__ - You can create, load and play levels with a limited set of entities.
* __That player code looks rather awful, will it kill me?__ - Hopefully not. It's stolen from the previous iteration of the project and serves as a nice test player in the meantime.
* __I'm crazy, can I code your code in my project?__ - Sure, but please don't simply steal the lot and brand it as your own. Just learn from it ;)
