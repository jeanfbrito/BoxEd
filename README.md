# Frequently Asked Questions

### What can it currently do?
You can create, load and play levels with a limited set of entities.

### That player code looks rather awful, will it kill me?
Hopefully not. It's stolen from the previous iteration of the project and serves as a nice test player in the meantime.

### I'm crazy, can I use your code in my project?
Sure, but please don't simply steal the lot and brand it as your own. Just learn from it ;)
